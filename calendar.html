  <p>Fultonvale Outdoor Arena Booking Calendar</p>
  <p>Colchester Ag Members may book arena as early as November 1 for the next year April through October. For clubs or groups looking to book the arena, at least 20% of your group must be Colchester Ag members and we will need your membership list from the previous year at time of booking and current year April 1.  Bookings will open to the public April 1.  Number of hours booked may be limited based on group size. <a href="https://colchesteragsociety.org/index_files/Page1233.htm" target="_blank"'> Link to Membership page</a></p>
  <p> Weekend daytime bookings are for groups only doing a half or full day show or clinic and take priority to any booking or public riding booked if the event runs late into the evening.   Individual bookings will be limited to 1 hour on weekdays before 5pm, Fridays or Sunday evenings.  Tuesday and Saturday evenings between 6-8pm are open for shared public riding and cannot be booked by any individual or group.  If there is no booking, arena is open for anyone to ride, but for exclusive use, it must be booked ahead.  </p>
  <p>The arena can be booked at no charge by e-mailing Lisa or phone 780-237-7587 at least 1 month ahead.  All users are required to clean up after and haul out their garbage and manure.  Bring your own garbage bags, toilet paper & hand sanitizer for your events.  Please note that harrowing the arena is left up to the groups using it (there is an old set there - use them at your own risk).  </p>

  <p>For bookings wanting the gate and concession building keys, please contact Lisa at least 2 weeks ahead of your booking to make arrangements.  We will charge a $100 clean-up fee if grounds are not left clean of garbage, manure and in good condition.  If not paid, we will cancel that groups future bookings.</p>
