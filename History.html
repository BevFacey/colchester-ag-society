    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>Over the years the society has funded events and building projects in local community leagues, schools, youth  & sports groups, seniors clubs, Strathcona Food Bank & Christmas Bureau,  Bookmobile, Strathcona Museum & library,  Health Care Foundation, Festival Place, Therapeutic Horseback Riding and for 30 years the Strathcona Country Fair.</p>
    <p>The society has contributed to lasting projects such as Sherwood Natural Area, Heritage Mile, Strathcona Olympiette Centre Mural, Lakeview Fireplace & Chimney restoration and Fultonvale Outdoor Riding Arena facility & events.</p>
    <p>The Fultonvale Outdoor Riding Arena’s ongoing improvements and maintenance provides a good venue for Colchester & District Ag. Society’s funded horse shows and various other horse club events. </p>
    <p>Our recent endeavor is the Edible Forest. 90 fruit trees, shrubs and canes were planted in 2022. Located at the Colchester Community Hall they will allow anyone an opportunity to see how they develop and share in the annual harvest in the future.</p>
